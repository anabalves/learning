# 📚 Learning Repository

Welcome to my **learning repository** — a collection of study notes, practical exercises, and topic-based summaries from my ongoing technical education.

Here you'll find materials organized by subject, not by platform, making it easier to revisit and apply knowledge in real-world scenarios.  
All content was produced while studying through platforms like **Full Cycle**, **LinuxTips**, **Alura**, **Udemy**, and others.

## 📂 Repository Structure

```shell
learning/
├── git/               → Git fundamentals, commands, workflows
├── docker/            → Containers, Dockerfiles, image building
├── kubernetes/        → Cluster orchestration, deployments, services
├── linux/             → Shell commands, file system, permissions
├── networking/        → TCP/IP, DNS, ports, routing basics
├── terraform/         → Infrastructure as Code, modules, providers
├── ...
└── README.md          → (you are here)
```

Each folder includes:

- Notes from one or more courses or platforms.
- Example commands, diagrams, or use cases.
- A `README.md` to summarize key takeaways.

##  🧠 Topics Covered

This repository covers key concepts across:

- **Version Control** – Git CLI, branching, GitHub workflows.
- **Containers** – Dockerfiles, images, volumes, Compose.
- **Orchestration** – Kubernetes basics, deployments, Helm, monitoring.
- **Linux & Shell** – Common commands, permissions, file system navigation.
- **Networking** – IP addressing, DNS, routing, firewalls.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** – Terraform basics, resource provisioning.

## 📝 Notes

Content is written in **English** for consistency and public sharing.

Platforms are mentioned inside the files when relevant.

This is a **work in progress** — new topics will be added as I keep learning.

Most notes are hands-on and meant to be practical and applicable.
