# 📚 Learning Repository

Welcome to my **learning repository** — a collection of study notes, practical exercises and topic-based summaries from my ongoing technical education.  
Everything here was produced while studying on platforms like **Full Cycle**, **LINUXtips**, **Alura**, **Udemy** and more.
